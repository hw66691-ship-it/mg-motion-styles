## 怎么用

1. 新建一个空文件夹，在里面打开一个能写代码、能执行命令的 AI 助手（例如 Claude Code）。本机需要能跑网页渲染（Node + Chrome）和 ffmpeg。
2. 把下面「提示词」整段复制进去发送。
3. 想换成自己的内容：改 `Creative seed` 里的故事、品牌名、文案和配色，或者改 `Output` 里的尺寸（比如竖屏 1080×1920）。不要删 `Signature features` 那一段，它是这种风格被一眼认出来的依据。
4. 想再提高：成片出来后，另开一个 AI 用 [rubric.md](../rubric.md) 评审，把评审意见贴回给制作的 AI 再改一轮。原片就是这样改了两轮。

## 提示词

```text
You are the director, motion designer, engineer and sound designer of ONE 10-second motion-design film.
The goal is the most classic, yet most stunning form of this style — award-shortlist / high-end commercial quality. A clean,
template-looking result is a fail. Benchmarks: Buck, ManvsMachine, Ordinary Folk, Giant Ant, Territory Studio, Apple keynote
motion, Pentagram motion identities, top Behance/Motionographer features, top 抖音/B站 designer accounts.

# Style
几何构成 / 包豪斯 Geometric / Bauhaus Motion

# Output (fixed)
- 1920×1080, 30 fps, exactly 10.000 s (300 frames), H.264 MP4 with stereo AAC audio (48 kHz), mastered to −14 LUFS
  integrated, true peak ≤ −1 dBTP. Final file: video.mp4.

# Suggested technical route
HTML: SVG/Canvas + GSAP on a strict modular grid, beat grid at 120 BPM
(You may choose a better route if it clearly raises quality; say why.)

# Creative seed
「包豪斯动态海报」Bauhaus 1919 kinetic poster — mechanical, rational, musical.
- Cream paper (#F1E9DA), primaries red #E03C31, yellow #F2B705, blue #1E4FA3, black #111; strict modular grid (e.g. 240px modules); every move is an integer number of modules; every landing on a grid line.
- 120 BPM (0.5 s/beat): each beat a module acts — quarter circles rotate 90° about a corner pivot, semicircles slide one module, triangles flip, squares split; rotation pivots alternate (own centre / corner / frame centre).
- 0–2s grid lines draw & the first red circle lands; 2–6s the composition assembles into a Kandinsky/Bauhaus poster; 6–8s phase-shifted cascade wave across the grid on the drop; 8–10s freeze into a perfect poster with Swiss typography: "BAUHAUS" set vertically in heavy geometric sans + small caps "FORM · FARBE · FUNKTION".
- Easing: power2.inOut or linear — NO overshoot; subtle paper tooth + slight print misregistration allowed.
Sound: minimal techno/click — each flip = a pitched click/blip, kick on quarters.

You are the director: you may change the concept, copy, story beats and brand names if you find a stronger idea, but the result must remain the CANONICAL, instantly-recognisable form of this style and must hit its signature features below.

# Signature features and key techniques (the result is judged against these)
圆、三角、矩形在严格网格上做精确的平移、旋转、缩放，三原色+黑白的限定色板，机械理性的秩序美。源自包豪斯与瑞士国际主义平面传统（Adobe 曾与 Bauhaus 档案馆合作 Hidden Treasures 项目），也是动态海报（kinetic poster）的主流语言，与音乐节拍天然合拍。
视觉特征 基础几何形, 红黄蓝黑限定色, 严格网格对齐, 旋转以几何中心为轴, 节拍驱动的模块化运动
关键技法 一切运动锚定网格：位移距离=网格模数整数倍，落点必在网格线上
缓动克制：easeInOutQuad 或干脆匀速，禁用 overshoot——机械感是特征不是缺陷
节拍驱动：每个几何元素在节拍点瞬时出现/翻转，一拍一个动作，类似我们已做的卡点逻辑
旋转轴心玩法：绕自身中心、绕边缘顶点、绕画面中心三种交替制造韵律
生成式变体：Processing/p5.js 用三角函数相位差批量驱动几何阵列（国内动态海报圈主流做法）

# How to work
1. Treatment. Write down one clear idea: a hook in the first 0.5 s (never open on more than 0.3 s of empty or black), an
   escalation, one unmistakable hero moment at ~60–75 % of the runtime, and a composed end frame held ~0.8–1.2 s with living
   micro-motion. Map every signature feature above to a moment. Keep one cue sheet (beats and hit times) that both the
   picture and the sound read from.
2. Key frames before motion. Build the look, render stills at 6–10 key times and actually look at them. Each still should be
   poster-worthy: composition, hierarchy, negative space, type set properly (kerning, line-height, weight contrast, CJK
   punctuation, ~5 % safe margins). Iterate until nothing looks default, generic, cramped or "AI-template".
3. Motion. Build the choreography and preview at low resolution. Step through the fastest moves frame by frame: spacing,
   easing, arcs, overlap, anticipation and follow-through, motion blur. No unintended dead spans; the energy follows the music.
4. Sound. Write genre-correct music and sound design locked to the cue sheet. Check that visual hits land on audio onsets.
   Master to the output spec.
5. Final. Render at full resolution (motion blur where apt), then check: exactly 10.00 s, resolution, fps, audio present and at
   the right loudness, no black frames, no fallback fonts or tofu, no clipped elements at the frame edges, no shimmer on thin
   lines, no gradient banding. Fix and repeat until you would submit it to a festival.
6. Write an honest self-critique: what is strongest, what is weakest, what you would do with more time.

# Rules
- Rendering must be deterministic: every frame is a pure function of time t. Seeded randomness only; physics and particles
  precomputed or closed-form; no real-time clocks; no state-triggered CSS transitions. A reliable route: a web page that can
  draw any time t on request, captured frame by frame with a headless browser and encoded with ffmpeg (or a Blender script
  that renders a PNG sequence).
- Assets: only CC0 / public domain / OFL / Apache / free-for-commercial-use. Record each source and licence in CREDITS.md.
  No real brand trademarks; invent brand names.
- On-screen text must be correct and natural: idiomatic Chinese, proper CJK punctuation, no typos.

# Craft checklist (what a jury looks for)
- Style authenticity: an expert names the style in one second; every signature technique is present and executed correctly.
- Motion craft: purposeful easing (no linear unless mechanical by design), overlap and stagger, anticipation and
  follow-through, arcs, squash and stretch where the style allows, consistent physics, motion blur where apt; transitions
  carried by elements, not crossfades.
- Rhythm: hits locked to the music; contrast between busy and calm; no monotony.
- Design: strong composition, grid, typographic hierarchy, controlled palette; texture and finishing (grain, glow, vignette)
  only where the style wants it; nothing looks accidental.
- Technical polish: no jitter (unless intended), no popping, no aliasing, no banding, no fallback fonts, no half-loaded images.
- Sound: genre-correct, musical, synced, mastered.

# Before you deliver, score yourself honestly
1–10 on style fidelity, concept wow, motion craft, design & typography, finish & texture, sound & sync, technical
(6 = template-level, 8 = high-end agency, 9 = award shortlist). Aim for 9; fix whatever scores lowest first.

# Deliver
video.mp4, plus a short report: the concept in two sentences; a beat sheet with timecodes; how each signature feature is
realised; the tech route; check numbers (duration, resolution, fps, loudness, true peak); your honest top-3 weaknesses.
