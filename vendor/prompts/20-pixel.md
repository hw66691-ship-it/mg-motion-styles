# 像素风 Pixel Art / 8-bit

**原片**：PIXEL QUEST 像素冒险 · 1920×1080 · 30 fps · 10 秒 · AI 评审终评 8.07 / 10

## 怎么用

1. 新建一个空文件夹，在里面打开一个能写代码、能执行命令的 AI 助手（例如 Claude Code）。本机需要能跑网页渲染（Node + Chrome）和 ffmpeg。
2. 把下面「提示词」整段复制进去发送。
3. 想换成自己的内容：改 `Creative seed` 里的故事、品牌名、文案和配色，或者改 `Output` 里的尺寸（比如竖屏 1080×1920）。不要删 `Signature features` 那一段，它是这种风格被一眼认出来的依据。
4. 想再提高：成片出来后，另开一个 AI 用 [rubric.md](../rubric.md) 评审，把评审意见贴回给制作的 AI 再改一轮。原片就是这样改了两轮。

## 提示词

```text
You are the director, motion designer, engineer and sound designer of ONE 10-second motion-design film.
The goal is the most classic, yet most stunning form of this style — award-shortlist / high-end commercial quality. A clean,
template-looking result is a fail. Benchmarks: Buck, ManvsMachine, Ordinary Folk, Giant Ant, Territory Studio, Apple keynote
motion, Pentagram motion identities, top Behance/Motionographer features, top 抖音/B站 designer accounts.

# Style
像素风 Pixel Art / 8-bit

# Output (fixed)
- 1920×1080, 30 fps, exactly 10.000 s (300 frames), H.264 MP4 with stereo AAC audio (48 kHz), mastered to −14 LUFS
  integrated, true peak ≤ −1 dBTP. Final file: video.mp4.

# Suggested technical route
HTML Canvas at 320×180 internal resolution, integer-scaled ×6 with nearest-neighbour; sprites authored as pixel arrays in code; limited palette
(You may choose a better route if it clearly raises quality; say why.)

# Creative seed
「像素冒险 PIXEL QUEST」A retro side-scroller title/attract sequence.
- Internal 320×180, ×6 nearest-neighbour; limited palette (PICO-8-like 16–32 colours) with dithered sky gradient; 3–4 parallax layers (sky, far mountains, mid forest/city, near ground tiles) moving by whole pixels.
- Hero sprite (hand-authored 16×16–24×24, 6–8 frame run cycle at ~10–12 fps) runs, jumps, collects coins (sparkle), bops a slime; the palette shifts day → sunset; a treasure chest opens with a light burst.
- Dialogue box with pixel CJK font typing 「欢迎来到像素世界！」; chunky pixel logo "PIXEL QUEST" drops in with shine sweep; optional CRT pass (scanlines, slight barrel, phosphor glow) that doesn't blur pixels into mush.
- Strictly: nearest-neighbour, integer pixel positions, stepped timing (no smooth easing on sprites).
Sound: chiptune (pulse lead, triangle bass, noise drums) + jump/coin/chest SFX.

You are the director: you may change the concept, copy, story beats and brand names if you find a stronger idea, but the result must remain the CANONICAL, instantly-recognisable form of this style and must hit its signature features below.

# Signature features and key techniques (the result is judged against these)
低分辨率大颗粒像素 + 有限色板 + 低帧率精灵动画的复古游戏美学，在 B 站游戏区（MC、泰拉瑞亚、独立游戏）、8-bit 音乐 MV 和品牌怀旧营销中常见；Aseprite 教程在 B 站有 10 万+ 播放的稳定学习生态。
视觉特征 大颗粒像素与硬边缘, 有限色板(8~32色), 8~12fps 精灵帧动画, 抖动渐变 dithering, CRT 扫描线滤镜
关键技法 Aseprite 绘制精灵表（sprite sheet）+ 序列帧循环（走路 6~8 帧、呼吸 2~4 帧）
缩放必须最近邻插值（CSS image-rendering: pixelated），杜绝抗锯齿糊边
动画用 steps() 阶梯时序而非平滑缓动，保持逐帧感
视差卷轴背景：远中近三层不同速度整像素平移
可选 CRT 后处理：扫描线+桶形畸变+磷光辉光

# How to work
1. Treatment. Write down one clear idea: a hook in the first 0.5 s (never open on more than 0.3 s of empty or black), an
   escalation, one unmistakable hero moment at ~60–75 % of the runtime, and a composed end frame held ~0.8–1.2 s with living
   micro-motion. Map every signature feature above to a moment. Keep one cue sheet (beats and hit times) that both the
   picture and the sound read from.
2. Key frames before motion. Build the look, render stills at 6–10 key times and actually look at them. Each still should be
   poster-worthy: composition, hierarchy, negative space, type set properly (kerning, line-height, weight contrast, CJK
   punctuation, ~5 % safe margins). Iterate until nothing looks default, generic, cramped or "AI-template".
3. Motion. Build the choreography and preview at low resolution. Step through the fastest moves frame by frame: spacing,
   easing, arcs, overlap, anticipation and follow-through, motion blur. No unintended dead spans; the energy follows the music.
4. Sound. Write genre-correct music and sound design locked to the cue sheet. Check that visual hits land on audio onsets.
   Master to the output spec.
5. Final. Render at full resolution (motion blur where apt), then check: exactly 10.00 s, resolution, fps, audio present and at
   the right loudness, no black frames, no fallback fonts or tofu, no clipped elements at the frame edges, no shimmer on thin
   lines, no gradient banding. Fix and repeat until you would submit it to a festival.
6. Write an honest self-critique: what is strongest, what is weakest, what you would do with more time.

# Rules
- Rendering must be deterministic: every frame is a pure function of time t. Seeded randomness only; physics and particles
  precomputed or closed-form; no real-time clocks; no state-triggered CSS transitions. A reliable route: a web page that can
  draw any time t on request, captured frame by frame with a headless browser and encoded with ffmpeg (or a Blender script
  that renders a PNG sequence).
- Assets: only CC0 / public domain / OFL / Apache / free-for-commercial-use. Record each source and licence in CREDITS.md.
  No real brand trademarks; invent brand names.
- On-screen text must be correct and natural: idiomatic Chinese, proper CJK punctuation, no typos.

# Craft checklist (what a jury looks for)
- Style authenticity: an expert names the style in one second; every signature technique is present and executed correctly.
- Motion craft: purposeful easing (no linear unless mechanical by design), overlap and stagger, anticipation and
  follow-through, arcs, squash and stretch where the style allows, consistent physics, motion blur where apt; transitions
  carried by elements, not crossfades.
- Rhythm: hits locked to the music; contrast between busy and calm; no monotony.
- Design: strong composition, grid, typographic hierarchy, controlled palette; texture and finishing (grain, glow, vignette)
  only where the style wants it; nothing looks accidental.
- Technical polish: no jitter (unless intended), no popping, no aliasing, no banding, no fallback fonts, no half-loaded images.
- Sound: genre-correct, musical, synced, mastered.

# Before you deliver, score yourself honestly
1–10 on style fidelity, concept wow, motion craft, design & typography, finish & texture, sound & sync, technical
(6 = template-level, 8 = high-end agency, 9 = award shortlist). Aim for 9; fix whatever scores lowest first.

# Deliver
video.mp4, plus a short report: the concept in two sentences; a beat sheet with timecodes; how each signature feature is
realised; the tech route; check numbers (duration, resolution, fps, loudness, true peak); your honest top-3 weaknesses.
