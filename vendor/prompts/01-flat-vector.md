## 怎么用

1. 新建一个空文件夹，在里面打开一个能写代码、能执行命令的 AI 助手（例如 Claude Code）。本机需要能跑网页渲染（Node + Chrome）和 ffmpeg。
2. 把下面「提示词」整段复制进去发送。
3. 想换成自己的内容：改 `Creative seed` 里的故事、品牌名、文案和配色，或者改 `Output` 里的尺寸（比如竖屏 1080×1920）。不要删 `Signature features` 那一段，它是这种风格被一眼认出来的依据。
4. 想再提高：成片出来后，另开一个 AI 用 [rubric.md](../rubric.md) 评审，把评审意见贴回给制作的 AI 再改一轮。原片就是这样改了两轮。

## 提示词

```text
You are the director, motion designer, engineer and sound designer of ONE 10-second motion-design film.
The goal is the most classic, yet most stunning form of this style — award-shortlist / high-end commercial quality. A clean,
template-looking result is a fail. Benchmarks: Buck, ManvsMachine, Ordinary Folk, Giant Ant, Territory Studio, Apple keynote
motion, Pentagram motion identities, top Behance/Motionographer features, top 抖音/B站 designer accounts.

# Style
扁平矢量动画 Flat / Vector 2D Motion Graphics

# Output (fixed)
- 1920×1080, 30 fps, exactly 10.000 s (300 frames), H.264 MP4 with stereo AAC audio (48 kHz), mastered to −14 LUFS
  integrated, true peak ≤ −1 dBTP. Final file: video.mp4.

# Suggested technical route
HTML: SVG + GSAP (CustomEase/CustomBounce/MorphSVG); motion blur mb=4 for fast moves
(You may choose a better route if it clearly raises quality; say why.)

# Creative seed
「一镜到底的扁平世界」One-continuous-shot brand explainer, the canonical Motion-Ocean/Google-explainer form, pushed to showreel polish.
- 0.0–1.2s HOOK: empty bold color field; a single saturated circle drops in with the three-phase anticipation → stretch → squash → overshoot → settle. Immediately readable craft.
- 1.2–3.0s: the circle becomes the sun; a flat city pops up building-by-building with 2–4 frame stagger (each with its own mini overshoot), clouds slide, birds flap.
- 3.0–5.5s: camera pushes into one window → a geometric character at a desk (limb rig with anchor rotations, head bob, blink) reacts; phone pings.
- 5.5–8.0s: the notification bubble expands to fill the frame as a SHAPE WIPE transition; inside, icons burst in a choreographed rhythm (bar chart grows, check mark draws, heart pops, coin flips).
- 8.0–10.0s: element-driven transition — everything collapses/flies into a logo lockup for an invented brand (e.g. "Popwise") + tagline, elastic settle, 1s hold with micro-motion.
Rules: one hero moves at a time; squash&stretch ~10%; secondary action & follow-through; element-driven transitions (an object flies out and carries the cut); strictly flat (no gradients), bold 5–6 color palette (e.g. ultramarine #2B2BFF, coral #FF5A4E, sunflower #FFC62B, mint #2EE6A8, cream #FFF6E9, ink #151433).
Sound: upbeat future-bass/pop ~120 BPM; pop/boing/whoosh on each entry, synced to the frame.

You are the director: you may change the concept, copy, story beats and brand names if you find a stronger idea, but the result must remain the CANONICAL, instantly-recognisable form of this style and must hit its signature features below.

# Signature features and key techniques (the result is judged against these)
MG 动画最主流的基本盘风格，源自 Google Material/企业解释视频（explainer）传统。纯色几何化的人物与场景、无描边或极简描边、大色块撞色，一切元素都是矢量形状。常见于 SaaS 产品宣传、科普解说、企业年报视频。
视觉特征 纯色大色块, 几何化角色, 无渐变或极少渐变, 干净留白, 高饱和品牌色板, 元素弹性入退场
关键技法 AE Shape Layer + 父子级 null 控制层级，人物四肢用锚点旋转做 rig
弹性缓动是灵魂：overshoot 用 cubic-bezier(0.34,1.56,0.64,1) 或 AE 里 70~85% influence 的贝塞尔手柄；入场'预备-冲出-回弹'三段式
元素错峰入场（stagger 2~4 帧），同一时刻只让一个主体动
30fps 居多；位移动画带 10% 左右 squash&stretch 增加弹性
转场常用色块擦除（shape wipe）或元素飞出带动整场切换

# How to work
1. Treatment. Write down one clear idea: a hook in the first 0.5 s (never open on more than 0.3 s of empty or black), an
   escalation, one unmistakable hero moment at ~60–75 % of the runtime, and a composed end frame held ~0.8–1.2 s with living
   micro-motion. Map every signature feature above to a moment. Keep one cue sheet (beats and hit times) that both the
   picture and the sound read from.
2. Key frames before motion. Build the look, render stills at 6–10 key times and actually look at them. Each still should be
   poster-worthy: composition, hierarchy, negative space, type set properly (kerning, line-height, weight contrast, CJK
   punctuation, ~5 % safe margins). Iterate until nothing looks default, generic, cramped or "AI-template".
3. Motion. Build the choreography and preview at low resolution. Step through the fastest moves frame by frame: spacing,
   easing, arcs, overlap, anticipation and follow-through, motion blur. No unintended dead spans; the energy follows the music.
4. Sound. Write genre-correct music and sound design locked to the cue sheet. Check that visual hits land on audio onsets.
   Master to the output spec.
5. Final. Render at full resolution (motion blur where apt), then check: exactly 10.00 s, resolution, fps, audio present and at
   the right loudness, no black frames, no fallback fonts or tofu, no clipped elements at the frame edges, no shimmer on thin
   lines, no gradient banding. Fix and repeat until you would submit it to a festival.
6. Write an honest self-critique: what is strongest, what is weakest, what you would do with more time.

# Rules
- Rendering must be deterministic: every frame is a pure function of time t. Seeded randomness only; physics and particles
  precomputed or closed-form; no real-time clocks; no state-triggered CSS transitions. A reliable route: a web page that can
  draw any time t on request, captured frame by frame with a headless browser and encoded with ffmpeg (or a Blender script
  that renders a PNG sequence).
- Assets: only CC0 / public domain / OFL / Apache / free-for-commercial-use. Record each source and licence in CREDITS.md.
  No real brand trademarks; invent brand names.
- On-screen text must be correct and natural: idiomatic Chinese, proper CJK punctuation, no typos.

# Craft checklist (what a jury looks for)
- Style authenticity: an expert names the style in one second; every signature technique is present and executed correctly.
- Motion craft: purposeful easing (no linear unless mechanical by design), overlap and stagger, anticipation and
  follow-through, arcs, squash and stretch where the style allows, consistent physics, motion blur where apt; transitions
  carried by elements, not crossfades.
- Rhythm: hits locked to the music; contrast between busy and calm; no monotony.
- Design: strong composition, grid, typographic hierarchy, controlled palette; texture and finishing (grain, glow, vignette)
  only where the style wants it; nothing looks accidental.
- Technical polish: no jitter (unless intended), no popping, no aliasing, no banding, no fallback fonts, no half-loaded images.
- Sound: genre-correct, musical, synced, mastered.

# Before you deliver, score yourself honestly
1–10 on style fidelity, concept wow, motion craft, design & typography, finish & texture, sound & sync, technical
(6 = template-level, 8 = high-end agency, 9 = award shortlist). Aim for 9; fix whatever scores lowest first.

# Deliver
video.mp4, plus a short report: the concept in two sentences; a beat sheet with timecodes; how each signature feature is
realised; the tech route; check numbers (duration, resolution, fps, loudness, true peak); your honest top-3 weaknesses.
