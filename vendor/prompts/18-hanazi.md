# 综艺花字 Variety Show Kinetic Captions (Hanazi)

**原片**：喵呜日记 EP.07「今日份快乐」 · 1080×1920 · 30 fps · 10 秒 · AI 评审终评 7.64 / 10

## 怎么用

1. 新建一个空文件夹，在里面打开一个能写代码、能执行命令的 AI 助手（例如 Claude Code）。本机需要能跑网页渲染（Node + Chrome）和 ffmpeg。
2. 把下面「提示词」整段复制进去发送。
3. 想换成自己的内容：改 `Creative seed` 里的故事、品牌名、文案和配色，或者改 `Output` 里的尺寸（比如竖屏 1080×1920）。不要删 `Signature features` 那一段，它是这种风格被一眼认出来的依据。
4. 想再提高：成片出来后，另开一个 AI 用 [rubric.md](../rubric.md) 评审，把评审意见贴回给制作的 AI 再改一轮。原片就是这样改了两轮。

## 提示词

```text
You are the director, motion designer, engineer and sound designer of ONE 10-second motion-design film.
The goal is the most classic, yet most stunning form of this style — award-shortlist / high-end commercial quality. A clean,
template-looking result is a fail. Benchmarks: Buck, ManvsMachine, Ordinary Folk, Giant Ant, Territory Studio, Apple keynote
motion, Pentagram motion identities, top Behance/Motionographer features, top 抖音/B站 designer accounts.

# Style
综艺花字 Variety Show Kinetic Captions (Hanazi)

# Output (fixed)
- 1080×1920, 30 fps, exactly 10.000 s (300 frames), H.264 MP4 with stereo AAC audio (48 kHz), mastered to −14 LUFS
  integrated, true peak ≤ −1 dBTP. Final file: video.mp4.

# Suggested technical route
HTML DOM/SVG: multi-layer text-stroke 花字 components + spring pops + SVG burst/sweat/sparkle decorations over a pet-vlog footage layer (CC0 photos with Ken Burns + handheld shake + punch-ins)
(You may choose a better route if it clearly raises quality; say why.)

# Creative seed
「萌宠综艺感 vlog」综艺花字 in its native habitat — reactive captions over a pet vlog.
- Base layer that feels like footage: CC0/PD cat or dog photos from /assets/images with slow Ken Burns, subtle handheld shake, snap punch-in zooms on 'moments' (you may also build a stylised scene if photos look weak).
- 花字 moments synced to beats: title "今日份快乐" (fill gradient + thick white stroke + coloured outer stroke + drop shadow, rounded heavy font), "？？？" bouncing question marks, "震惊!!" inside a radial 爆炸框 with speed lines + 放射线 flash, "（小声）" small aside, "绝绝子" with sparkles, sweat drops, a "猫主子认证" stamp.
- Motion: pop 0 → 1.15 → 1.0 in ~8 frames, per-character bounce with 2-frame stagger, slight rotation, gentle wiggle while holding; appear 2–3 frames after the audio/visual moment. High-saturation pink/yellow/cyan with white strokes.
Sound: bouncy variety-show bed (pizzicato/bass/claps) + boing, pop, ding, slide whistle, record scratch on '？？？'.

You are the director: you may change the concept, copy, story beats and brand names if you find a stronger idea, but the result must remain the CANONICAL, instantly-recognisable form of this style and must hit its signature features below.

# Signature features and key techniques (the result is judged against these)
源自电视综艺后期的情绪化装饰字幕：多层描边圆体字带弹性入场，跟随人物情绪变色变形，配打击音效。现已下沉为 vlog、萌宠、访谈、搞笑二创的通用包装语言，剪映内置大量花字模板，B 站也有免费花字样式包流通。
视觉特征 多层描边圆体/胖体字, 高饱和撞色+白边+投影, 弹性 pop 入场, 配合音效出现, 手绘装饰符号（爆炸框/汗滴/闪光）
关键技法 字体三层结构：填充色+粗白描边+彩色外描边/投影（CSS 可用多层 text-shadow 或 SVG stroke 模拟）
入场 overshoot：scale 0→1.15→1.0（约 8 帧），或逐字弹跳错帧 2 帧
情绪匹配：吐槽用歪斜手写体、惊讶用放射线爆炸框、尴尬用汗滴符号
出现时机对齐笑点/音效，比语音晚 2~3 帧更自然
长时间驻留花字加轻微 wiggle 保持活性

# How to work
1. Treatment. Write down one clear idea: a hook in the first 0.5 s (never open on more than 0.3 s of empty or black), an
   escalation, one unmistakable hero moment at ~60–75 % of the runtime, and a composed end frame held ~0.8–1.2 s with living
   micro-motion. Map every signature feature above to a moment. Keep one cue sheet (beats and hit times) that both the
   picture and the sound read from.
2. Key frames before motion. Build the look, render stills at 6–10 key times and actually look at them. Each still should be
   poster-worthy: composition, hierarchy, negative space, type set properly (kerning, line-height, weight contrast, CJK
   punctuation, ~5 % safe margins). Iterate until nothing looks default, generic, cramped or "AI-template".
3. Motion. Build the choreography and preview at low resolution. Step through the fastest moves frame by frame: spacing,
   easing, arcs, overlap, anticipation and follow-through, motion blur. No unintended dead spans; the energy follows the music.
4. Sound. Write genre-correct music and sound design locked to the cue sheet. Check that visual hits land on audio onsets.
   Master to the output spec.
5. Final. Render at full resolution (motion blur where apt), then check: exactly 10.00 s, resolution, fps, audio present and at
   the right loudness, no black frames, no fallback fonts or tofu, no clipped elements at the frame edges, no shimmer on thin
   lines, no gradient banding. Fix and repeat until you would submit it to a festival.
6. Write an honest self-critique: what is strongest, what is weakest, what you would do with more time.

# Rules
- Rendering must be deterministic: every frame is a pure function of time t. Seeded randomness only; physics and particles
  precomputed or closed-form; no real-time clocks; no state-triggered CSS transitions. A reliable route: a web page that can
  draw any time t on request, captured frame by frame with a headless browser and encoded with ffmpeg (or a Blender script
  that renders a PNG sequence).
- Assets: only CC0 / public domain / OFL / Apache / free-for-commercial-use. Record each source and licence in CREDITS.md.
  No real brand trademarks; invent brand names.
- On-screen text must be correct and natural: idiomatic Chinese, proper CJK punctuation, no typos.

# Craft checklist (what a jury looks for)
- Style authenticity: an expert names the style in one second; every signature technique is present and executed correctly.
- Motion craft: purposeful easing (no linear unless mechanical by design), overlap and stagger, anticipation and
  follow-through, arcs, squash and stretch where the style allows, consistent physics, motion blur where apt; transitions
  carried by elements, not crossfades.
- Rhythm: hits locked to the music; contrast between busy and calm; no monotony.
- Design: strong composition, grid, typographic hierarchy, controlled palette; texture and finishing (grain, glow, vignette)
  only where the style wants it; nothing looks accidental.
- Technical polish: no jitter (unless intended), no popping, no aliasing, no banding, no fallback fonts, no half-loaded images.
- Sound: genre-correct, musical, synced, mastered.

# Before you deliver, score yourself honestly
1–10 on style fidelity, concept wow, motion craft, design & typography, finish & texture, sound & sync, technical
(6 = template-level, 8 = high-end agency, 9 = award shortlist). Aim for 9; fix whatever scores lowest first.

# Deliver
video.mp4, plus a short report: the concept in two sentences; a beat sheet with timecodes; how each signature feature is
realised; the tech route; check numbers (duration, resolution, fps, loudness, true peak); your honest top-3 weaknesses.
